# JSDemo

A starter project for writing scripts using the Lingo API.
1. Clone this repo
2. Create an API token and add it to apiToken.js
3. `npm start`

> Make sure you never share your api token. The apiToken.js file will be cloned but is included in the .gitignore to ensure it is not committed with changes back to your repo.
